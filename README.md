Circular Line and Priority Circular Line Project

Circular Line: creates an data structure that is similar to queue data structure. 
Using an array with a generic type I created a waiting line in which people can exit from the front and enter from the back only. 
Waiting line size is limitless because the array doubles every time it is full or called for manually.

Priority Circular Line: very similar to the previous description, only this deals with digits and positions them in an ascending order in an array. 

Tests for these codes can be found in the files where the expected outputs are written down in comments.
